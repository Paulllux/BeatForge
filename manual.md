BeatForge User Manual
Welcome to BeatForge, a straightforward drum machine plugin for creating beats. This manual is designed to be easy to understand, even for those new to music production. Below are the main features and instructions for using them.

1. Getting Started

Open BeatForge: Load it in your DAW (e.g., Ableton, Logic, or FL Studio).
Trial Mode: If a trial screen appears, click Start Trial to use it for 14 days. To unlock permanently, enter your email and activation code (obtained by clicking Purchase).
Main Screen: After activation, you’ll see the track area for creating beats.
Playback: BeatForge automatically starts playing when your DAW’s transport (play button) is activated, syncing with the DAW’s timeline and tempo.


2. Tracks and Drum Sounds
BeatForge supports up to 64 tracks, each with a drum sound (e.g., kick, snare, hi-hat).
Adding a Track

Click the Add Track button at the top left.
A new track appears in the track list.

Naming a Track

Double-click the track’s name (e.g., "Track 1") to rename it (e.g., "Kick" or "Snare").
Right-Click the Track Name: This opens a menu with options:
Load Sample: Select a new drum sound.
Select Output: Choose where the sound is routed (e.g., Main 1-2 or Aux channels). Each track can have its own output, allowing separate processing in your DAW (e.g., applying different effects to kick and snare).
Set MIDI Note: Assign the track to a MIDI note (see below).
Mute Group: Configure tracks to mute each other (e.g., open and closed hi-hats).
Delete Track: Remove the track.
Clear Hit Chances: Reset probability settings (see below).



Loading Samples

Right-click the track name and select Load Sample.
OR drag and drop a .wav, .mp3, or .aiff file onto a track.
Choose a sound from your computer (e.g., a kick drum sample).
To switch samples in the same folder, right-click the track name, go to Samples, and select another file.


3. Making Beats
Each track has 16 steps to create a beat pattern for one bar.
Turning Steps On/Off

Click a step box to turn it on (green) or off (grey).
Green steps play the drum sound during playback.

Setting Hit Chances

Right-click a step box to set a Hit Chance (5% to 100%).
This adds randomness, making the step play only sometimes (e.g., a 50% chance means it plays half the time).
Blue steps indicate a hit chance below 100%.

Copying and Pasting

Select a track in the Track Choice dropdown.
Click Copy to save the current bar’s pattern.
Click Paste to apply it to another bar.
Check Current Track Only to copy/paste one track, or uncheck to copy all tracks.

Changing Bars

Use Total Bars Up/Down (+/-) to set the number of bars in your song.
Use Current Bar Up/Down to switch between bars.
The Total Bars and Current Bar labels display the song’s length and the bar being edited.


4. Setting MIDI Notes

Right-click the track name and select Set MIDI Note.
Choose a MIDI note (e.g., C1, D#2) or "None".
This allows triggering the track via a MIDI keyboard or DAW MIDI track.
Useful for live performance or recording beats.


5. Saving and Loading Songs
Saving a Song

Click the Song button and select Save (for existing files) or Save As (to choose a new file).
Save as a .drsong file on your computer.

Loading a Song

Click the Song button and select Load Song.

Seamless Song Switching

BeatForge switches songs seamlessly at the next bar, even if the new song has different samples, bars, or settings.
No clicks or pops, making it ideal for live performances.


6. Drumkits
A drumkit is a set of tracks with their samples and settings (excluding beat patterns).
Saving a Drumkit

Click the Drumkit button and select Save or Save As.
Save as a .drkit file.

Loading a Drumkit

Click the Drumkit button and select Load.
OR choose a drumkit from the Default Drumkit dropdown.

7. Sound Shaping
Each track has controls to adjust its sound.
ADSR (Envelope)

Attack: How quickly the sound starts (0–20 ms).
Decay: How long it fades (0–1000 ms).
Sustain: How loud it remains (0–100%).
Release: How long it takes to stop (0–2000 ms).
Adjust the knobs to shape the sound (e.g., short attack for punchy kicks).

Distortion

Adjust the Distortion knob (1–10) to add grit or crunch.
Higher values increase the effect’s intensity.

EQ (Filters)

High Pass: Enable and set the cutoff (20 Hz–20 kHz) to remove low frequencies.
Low Pass: Enable and set the cutoff to remove high frequencies.
Useful for enhancing kicks or refining hi-hats.

Pitch

Adjust the Pitch knob (-12 to +12 semitones) to tune the sound.
Double-click to reset to 0.

Volume and Pan

Volume: Set the track’s loudness (0–100%).
Pan: Position the sound left or right (-100 to +100).
Double-click pan to center it.

Solo and Mute

Click S to solo a track (only that track plays).
Click M to mute a track (it won’t play).
Solo overrides mute.


8. Reverb (FX)
Add reverb to give drums a sense of space.
Loading a Reverb IR

Set the FX Mode dropdown to Internal Reverb.
Click Load IR and select a .wav or .aiff impulse response file.
The file name appears in the IR File Label.

Reverb Settings

Adjust the Reverb knob on each track to send sound to the reverb.
Use the Reverb Return Level knob to control reverb volume.

External FX

Set FX Mode to External Output to route reverb to a separate channel (select with FX Bus Output dropdown).
Useful for applying DAW effects.


9. Mute Groups

Right-click the track name and select Mute Group (None or Group 1–8).
Tracks in the same group mute each other when triggered (e.g., closed hi-hat stops open hi-hat).
